# History of Computation

An interactive network visualization mapping the evolution of computation through history.

## Overview

This project visualizes key people, inventions, and events that shaped the history of computation. The interactive network graph shows connections between historical figures, technological developments, and significant events to help understand the progression of computational technology over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Network Visualization**: Explore connections between key people, inventions, and events
- **Detailed Information**: Click on nodes or links to view detailed information
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Different node types (Person, Invention, Event) are color-coded for easy identification
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for the application
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code
- **Force Graph**: Using react-force-graph-2d for network visualization
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
